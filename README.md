# Classical Stability and Formation of Black Holes beyond General Relativity (PhD-Thesis)

This thesis delves into the formation, classical stability, and observational signatures of black holes within frameworks extending beyond general relativity. We construct gravity theories beyond the conventional paradigm by introducing additional fundamental fields.

The study begins with a numerical exploration of gravitational collapse in the context of the {\it k-essence} model, incorporating a scalar field with a non-canonical kinetic term. Notably, the scalar field propagates within an emergent spacetime characterized by an effective metric distinct from the gravitational metric. This leads to the emergence of two distinct horizons: the apparent and sonic horizons, associated with the collapse of the gravitational and effective metrics, respectively. The investigation focuses on a specific Lagrangian, $K(X) = X + \beta X^2$, shedding light on the formation and universal structural dynamics of these horizons.

Beyond scalar degrees of freedom, considerations of higher dimensions, supergravity, and string theories naturally introduce additional scalar and vector fields. Ensuring the viability of gravity theories with such fields necessitates a review of black hole stability to avoid Ostrogradsky instability. To this end, we undertake a study of the classical stability of the generalized Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar theory. Employing a perturbation formalism on a static and spherically symmetric background, we establish that black holes exhibit stability under specific conditions.

The thesis culminates in an exploration of a physical observable of black holes: the quasinormal modes for pure Lovelock black holes in particular dimensions. This analysis reveals the dependence of quasinormal mode frequencies on the intrinsic parameters of the black hole. We scrutinize how spacetime dimension influences the characteristic time and oscillation frequency of the ringdown signal, representing the final state of a perturbed black hole.
